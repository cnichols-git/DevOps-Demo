# DevOps-Demo

To do list:  
- ~~Set up git repo~~  
- Choose if or what software to use for the site  
- Setup DNS again using Terraform  
- Configure the droplet (user account, SSH keys, install nginx, etc...) using Ansible  
- Create/edit the static site code locally on your machine, check the code into GitHub  
- Setup GitHub Actions to push the generated site to the droplet on every commit  
<p>Once this is all set up I can edit locally and push approved changes to master, which will trigger a Github action that will update the site.</p>  
- Make a list off all the software being used to achieve this task  
- Make a visual map of how the process flow looks
